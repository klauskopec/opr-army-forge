# onepagerules - Army Forge

This application is an army list builder for the onepagerules game systems. Army data is pulled from the [OPR Webapp](https://webapp.onepagerules.com)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install dependencies with `yarn install`, then run the development server with `yarn dev`.

There are no database or API dependencies so the project will run locally.
